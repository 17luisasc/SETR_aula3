/**
 * @brief It fills an array with integers chosen by the user and the array has a 
 * size also chosen by the user.
 * Then it calls functions that give information about the array and about what it contains. 
 *
 * It is asked to the user what is the size that they want to give to the array.
 * If it is to big it to fit the size of the array, it asks for a new size.
 * Then it asks for values to fill the array.
 * After that User can chose a mode, acordingly with what they want to know about 
 * the array.
 * Mode 1: the User chooses a new value to add to the array;
 * Mode 2: returns the max value of the array;
 * Mode 3: returns the min value of the array;
 * Mode 4: returns the average of the array;
 * After the choice of the User, the programme is terminated. 
 * (there's only one oportunity for the user to choose)
 * 
 * @return Returns 0
